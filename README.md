**CIS 282**

**To turn in:**

- Attach a file rps\_lastname.rb as an attachment to the assignment in Canvas
- If you do the extra credit, attach a separate file rpsls\_lasthame.rb

**Coding Conventions** :

- Same as previous assignments

**To do:**

Design and implement an application that plays the Rock-Scissors-Paper game against the computer.  When played between two people, each person picks one of the three options (usually shown by a hand gesture) at the same time, and a winner is determined.  In the game,
     Rock beats Scissors
     Scissors beats paper
     Paper beats Rock

 Introduce (explain the program to the user and ask them if they want to play.  If not, provide a message.  If they do, continue on.  The program should randomly choose one of the three options (without revealing it), then prompt the user&#39;s selection.  At that point, the program reveals both choices and prints a statement indicating if the user won, the computer won, or if it was a tie.  Continue playing until the user chooses to stop, then print the number of user wins, losses and ties.

 You may be creative here as long as the purpose of the program is fulfilled.
 Remember to print the statistics for the game after each move and when the user decides to quit.

Extra Credit:

Implement the extended version of RPS which is:

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Scissors cuts paper Paper covers rock Rock crushes lizard

Lizard poisons Spock Spock smashes scissors Scissors decapitates lizard

Lizard eats paper Paper disproves Spock Spock vaporizes Rock

Rock crushes scissors

This must be done as a separate file.
